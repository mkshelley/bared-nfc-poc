    <p class="review-body">
      Leather is soft, very comfortable and didn’t need to break into the shoe.
      I was able to walk around with no blisters. Also fit perfectly for my wide feet and I loved the design.

      Perfect for travel especially since the shoe looks great and comfortable.
      I am wearing them during the day but can also continue into the night.
      I would definitely buy another pair!

      These loafers are just AMAZING! I can’t fault them in any way.
      I had zero blisters from the first wear, they go with everything in my wardrobe and are super comfy!
      Bought my usual size however I did add the half insoles and now they’re perfect.
      I highly recommend them!
